This program redacts social security numbers from all file in a directory and
its subdirectories. It is solved using python and takes 2 command line arguments.
To run the program, I use the following command on the Windows Powershell:
  python .\p2.py .\tests .\redactedtests
Where .\tests contains the input files and .\redactedtests is a folder to place
the redacted files.
